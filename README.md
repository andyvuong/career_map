# Alums: Where are they now?

Students often enter college with great dreams and ambitions. This data visualization helps you ponder why students study what they study and end up where they do. We want to answer questions like how often do people end up in industries unrelated to their major. We want to discover whether some majors are more prelevant than others during different years and why. If people end up working in an industry different from what they studied, can we discover a reason by examining global trends.
