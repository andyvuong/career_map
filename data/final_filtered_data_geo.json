In this topic, fast-responding storage resources are of huge interest to be studies as one alternative method providing inertia services.I also work on big data and its applications in power systems, conducted research on planning and real-time operation applications of Big Data analytics, e.g., data visualization for improving situational awareness.My research topics cover the issues related to electricity market and renewable integration into systems as well. I have done work on the probabilistic production simulation for systems with concentrated solar plants. I primarily constructed a versatile simulation tool to emulate the behavior of power systems with concentrated solar plants. In addition, I developed a capable real-time and day-ahead market simulation tool to investigate the potential benefits of coordinately dispatching concentrated solar plants and wind resources.",

Bill conceptually developed proposals and received funding to analyze biotic, hydrologic, hydraulic, geologic, geomorphic, stratigraphic, sediment and soil conditions as well as topographic data and remotely sensed imagery to formulate results and publish technical reports and peer-reviewed literature. Bill manages scientific research to analyze the evolution of landforms by researching the nature of the processes that create and change them. Bill applies his knowledge to reconstruct the geologic and geomorphic evolution of areas and specific sites. He conducts effective stream and watershed assessment using established protocols. This effort allows identification of environmental restoration projects that stabilize or naturalize the current geomorphic environment, naturalize current rates of landscape erosion and resulting sedimentation, and provide outreach and education.",

I research component physical and chemical properties to ascertain appropriate hazard classifications through the use of internal and external databases, my knowledge of GHS regulations, hazard communication, transportation classification, and my background in the sciences for authoring compliant SDSs.I work closely with project managers and other authors on all authoring projects, provide sales and sales call support when necessary, as well as provide regulatory consulting both on calls and in the form of projects. When applicable, I complete specific projects such as regulatory consulting, GHS chemical classification, replying to regulatory questions, and assessment of previous SDSs for compliance among other things.

Implementing measures that correct these problems prevents waste generation and reduces the potential for a wide range of risks and accidents.Innovation diffusion and adoption: Assess innovation performance, advantages and complexity. Conduct demonstrations and pilot trials as necessary to prove performance capabilities and develop design parameters.Systems Optimization: Leverage innovation and technology to maximize efficiency and productivity. This may include product design, manufacturing, supply chain, accounting, logistics, maintenance, service and customer operations.Circular economy development: Develop systems for recovering and distributing products, components and materials. Assess, test, develop and implement processes for remanufacturing, rebuilding, refurbishing, and recycling to the highest possible use. Energy efficiency: Modernization and optimization of production processes such as compressed air, pumping systems, process heating, and waste heat recovery. Distributed power generation with combined heat and power capabilities. Alternative and Renewable Energy: Distributed power generation from diverse fuel sources such as waste gases such as flare gas and mine methane. Power generation from biogas produced from landfills and the anaerobic digestion of livestock wastes, food wastes and municipal wastewater treatment.

And work it has. A direct mail piece for networking manufacturer McDATA netted an unheard of 43% response rate. Not bad when you consider that 3% in direct mail is considered quite good.Every project, no matter how big or small, deserves a big idea.

Implementing measures that correct these problems prevents waste generation and reduces the potential for a wide range of risks and accidents.Innovation diffusion and adoption: Assess innovation performance, advantages and complexity. Conduct demonstrations and pilot trials as necessary to prove performance capabilities and develop design parameters.Systems Optimization: Leverage innovation and technology to maximize efficiency and productivity. This may include product design, manufacturing, supply chain, accounting, logistics, maintenance, service and customer operations.Circular economy development: Develop systems for recovering and distributing products, components and materials. Assess, test, develop and implement processes for remanufacturing, rebuilding, refurbishing, and recycling to the highest possible use. Energy efficiency: Modernization and optimization of production processes such as compressed air, pumping systems, process heating, and waste heat recovery. Distributed power generation with combined heat and power capabilities. Alternative and Renewable Energy: Distributed power generation from diverse fuel sources such as waste gases such as flare gas and mine methane. Power generation from biogas produced from landfills and the anaerobic digestion of livestock wastes, food wastes and municipal wastewater treatment.

And work it has. A direct mail piece for networking manufacturer McDATA netted an unheard of 43% response rate. Not bad when you consider that 3% in direct mail is considered quite good.Every project, no matter how big or small, deserves a big idea.

Berger Investment Group has completed over 60 transactions in a short period of time with deals ranging from REOs, short sales, distressed note purchases, and tax deeds. By having an opportunistic approach, multifamily deal size can range from 2 units to 60+ units, with values in excess of $5 million.Berger Investment Group currently owns and manages over 200 multifamily units located in South Shore, Woodlawn, Jackson Park and Hyde Park. Through a hands-on approach, Berger Investment Group focuses on all aspects of a value-add transaction from purchasing properties directly from banks and other institutions, to managing the construction process from start to finish to ensure quality and cost control in order to generate the highest annual returns. Berger Investment Group takes an opportunistic approach to every transaction by evaluating the current market conditions and determining a buy and hold versus flip strategy. Berger Investment Group prides itself on the level of quality and service. Investing in typically low-income neighborhoods, Berger Investment Group provides condominium quality finishes in its rental product. Additionally, Berger Property Management (a subsidiary), oversees day-to-day operations of all properties.\"THINK...BIG\"",
